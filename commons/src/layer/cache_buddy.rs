/// Either contains metadata or a message describing the state
///
/// Why: The `CachedLayerDefinition` allows returning information about the cache state
/// from either `invalid_metadata_action` or `restored_layer_action` functions.
///
/// Because the function returns only a single type, that type must be the same for
/// all possible cache conditions (cleared or retained). Therefore, the type must be
/// able to represent information about the cache state when it's cleared or not.
///
/// This struct implements `Display` and `AsRef<str>` so if the end user only
/// wants to advertise the cache state, they can do so by passing the whole struct
/// to `format!` or `println!` without any further maniuplation. If they need
/// to inspect the previous metadata they can match on the enum and extract
/// what they need.
///
/// - Will only ever contain metadata when the cache is retained.
/// - Will contain a message when the cache is cleared, describing why it was cleared.
///   It is also allowable to return a message when the cache is retained, and the
///   message describes the state of the cache. (i.e. because a message is returned
///   does not guarantee the cache was cleared).
